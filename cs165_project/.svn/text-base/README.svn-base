Make:
	- server/
		type 'make'

	- client/
		type 'make'

Testing:
	Open 4 terminals.

	*Change port number if it cannot be bound*

	Terminal 1 -
		In server/:
			./server -port 4433 store

	Terminal 2 -
		In server/:
			./server -port 4444 retrieve

	Terminal 3 -
		In client/:
			echo "This is a test file" > test.txt

	Terminal 3 -
		In client/:
			./client -server localhost -port 4433 test.txt -operation store

	Terminal 4 -
		In client/:
			./client -server localhost -port 4444 test.txt -operation retrieve

Bugs/Errors:
	1)  When a client tries to connect, it may "hang" and "freeze". It will not continue to decrypt and process anything.

		Solution: Ctrl + c, please run it again.

	2)  Server may not decrypt the RSA challenge sent by the client side everytime even when it should.

		Solution: Breaks are used to acknowledge server challenge regardless of comparison between
		SHA1 hashes.

	3) Can only decrypt file size of ~60 bytes

	   Solution: None found
